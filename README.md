# Valynx

Valynx is a state-management library based on 'value links', and object-friendly twist on the functional notion of
lenses.

Valynx lets you create a single global state tree, but pass fragments of that state to components such as form fields
as if it were a local state.

## Status

This repo isn't yet usable as a library - right now it's just an example app.

## Example

See the content of [src/app/index.tsx](./src/app/index.tsx)

To run this example, do the usual thing:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000
